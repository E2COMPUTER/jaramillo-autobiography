  <p><mark><b>Jessica Ditan-Jaramillo</b>, born on the 26th of December 2004, is the third child and eldest daughter of <b>Ma. Dolores Ditan-Jaramillo</b> and <b>Cesar Dado-Jaramillo</b>. She was born and raised on the <em>"Gateway to Southern Philippines"</em> and <em>"The Land of Kasanggayahan"</em> — the <b>City of Sorsogon</b>, a city filled with adventurous wonders. Jessica's childhood was filled with trials and tribulations which in return made her grow up too fast and not enjoyed the most of what life had to offer. She missed out on a proper upbringing. At a very young age life placed adult-like burdens on her innocent heart that still wanted to play and frolic under the sun, and discover things about everything and anything at her own pace.
<br>
<br>
The Jaramillo family had four other children. <b>Justin Christopher Ditan-Jaramillo</b>, born on the 12th of June 1999, the first-born and eldest son of the family. <b>Joshua Miguel Ditan-Jaramillo</b>, born on the 19th of November 2000, the second eldest son after Justin. The fourth child and third son, <b>Christian Cesar Ditan-Jaramillo</b>, was born on the 7th of September 2006. Lastly, the youngest and second daughter — <b>Jilliane Ditan-Jaramillo</b>, born on the 3rd of April 2010. Jessica's family was big and loud, much like the challenges that constantly troubled them.
<br>
<br>
Despite her turbulent home life, Jessica had qualities to be proud of. She was a bright child, but family troubles hindered her from reaching her full potential. After graduating from kindergarten in 2011, she faced a whirlwind of trials. Before she could even enter elementary school, her mother, Dorise, decided to go abroad in search of better job opportunities to support the family. This change meant they would be left in their father's care—Cesar, a laborer without a permanent job due to his limited education.
<br>
<br>
Initially, everything went smoothly. Her mother would send money and gifts home, and they would talk through phone calls and video chats using their relative's computer. However, on July 4, 2011, her world began to crumble. Her grandmother, Winniefreda Dado-Jaramillo, passed away from a blood clot in her skull. To Jessica, her grandmother was everything; she provided a childhood worth cherishing. With her passing, Jessica felt as though she had lost a piece of herself. Their family grieved, her father juggled household responsibilities, and her mother worked abroad, leaving Jessica feeling lost and without comfort.
<br>
<br>
As their family dynamics shifted, her father's behavior deteriorated. He began drinking heavily, neglecting his children. He accused their mother of infidelity with someone abroad and sank into sorrow and resentment. He started to entertain other women and resorted to using physical discipline. Once aware of the home situation, Dorise sent money to her sister, intending for her to manage it, but this only worsened the family's troubles and deepened their rifts.
<br>
<br>
Throughout elementary and junior high school, Jessica and her siblings oscillated between living with their mother’s relatives and returning home. This instability significantly affected their relationships, lifestyle, and growth. Every two years, their mother would come home and surprise them with large packages filled with gifts and necessities, temporarily bringing the family together. However, each time she left, new conflicts would arise, and they would again go their separate ways.
<br>
<br>
Jessica stuck together with her younger siblings, Christian and Jilliane, who were equally malnourished and sickly. She loved them deeply and took care of them when their parents and relatives could not. Jessica shielded them from their father's anger and their relatives' judgments. As a result, she became extremely independent and knowledgeable about things beyond her years, although she often isolated herself from others.
<br>
<br>
During fifth to seventh grade, rather than focusing on her studies and striving for high marks, she devoted her time to chores and caring for her younger siblings. Unlike other children whose parents picked them up from school, she waited long hours for her father to finish work before taking her home.
<br>
<br>
In 2018, when her mother returned home permanently along with her father, who had been working in Pampanga, Jessica hoped that everything would stabilize and life would return to normal. However, unbeknownst to her, her mother had changed during her time abroad. The warm, kind, and welcoming woman Jessica remembered had become harsh, vulgar, and demanding. Her mother grew jealous and spiteful, favoring her sons and placing undue pressure on her daughters.
<br>
<br>
Over the years, Jessica grew distant from her family, maintaining only her relationships with her father and younger sister. While living with her mother, she became introverted and secretive. Attempts to date boys her age often ended poorly because her mother would hover over her, trying to control every aspect of her life. As a result, Jessica decided to distance herself from others, limiting her friendships and cutting off those who spoke behind her back. She learned to choose whom to place her trust carefully, suppress her self-expression, and tread carefully in her interactions.
<br>
<br>
During her senior high school years, she met the people she could proudly call her genuine friends. During her senior year of high school, Jessica met people she could call genuine friends. She became more open and was able to relate to their experiences. It was during this time that she met someone special — <b>Juste Rini Magbanua-Enteria</b>, the girl who captured her heart. Juste was among the few friends who made Jessica feel emotions she never knew she could experience. Whenever they were together, everything felt right; she felt liberated from the burdens of life and could envision herself becoming whatever she wanted to be. Gradually, Jessica began to change and discover the greater aspects of life.
<br>
<br>
On May 8, 2022, they officially became a couple. Juste introduced Jessica to her family, and Jessica reciprocated by introducing Juste to her father and sister, Jilliane. Jessica grew closer to Juste's family than she ever had with her own. Now, two years later, Jessica couldn't be happier as she moves forward in her life and their relationship. She has blossomed and developed to her full potential, caring less about others' opinions, judgments, and need for validation. Instead, she focuses on achieving her goals and living the happy and peaceful life she always wanted.
